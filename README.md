Prevents characters from playing their idle animations.

## Chat commands:
* !RemoveIdles    - Toggles the module off/on

Command is not case-sensitive. [slash](https://github.com/baldera-mods/slash) is supported but not required

## Info:
* Probably won't improve your fps or anything like that. 
* Useful for classes with annoying idles (I'm looking at you noisy ninjas -_-)
